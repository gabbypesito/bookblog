        <h2>100 Years of Solitude</h2>
        <p class="meta">Gabriel Garcia Marquez</p>
        <p class="excerpt">At first this book was frustrating with how confusing the setting was, until closer to the end where you realize that was on purpouse. It's a very bizzare and weird book, but thats what makes it such an interesting retelling of South American colonial history. Learning more about the context of the book and its author just made me like it more.</p>

        <h2>Schoolgirl</h2>
        <p class="meta">Osamu Dazai</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Although the authors other book, No Longer Human, is much more popular, I find Schoolgirl to be far more relatable in an uncomfortable way.</p>

        <h2>The Giver</h2>
        <p class="meta">Lois Lowry</p>
        <p class="excerpt">A sentimental one for me because this was one of the first books I ever thought of as a favorite. It's amazing how a novel targeted towards 12-13 year olds can communicate a complex theme about whatit means to live life in such a clear way.</p>

      <article class="post">
        <h2>Kafka on the Shore</h2>
        <p class="meta"> Haruki Murakami </p>
        <p class="excerpt">Aside from enjoying the bizzare adventure aspect of the book, I think that Murakami has a way of portraying "the human experience" in a really beautiful manner. I'm not really sure what he was going for with the ending though, but I don't think anyone does.</p>

        <h2>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</h2>
        <p class="meta">Ocean Vuong</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> A semi-autobiography about a queer boy who writes letters to his mother(a refugee from Vietnam) who cannot read. This was really personal to me, and I think the authors background as a poet makes his writing style really vivid and poetic. </p>
