        <h3>The Stolen White Elephant</h3>
        <p class="meta">Mark Twain</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> The only Mark Twin I've read other than parts of his autobiography. I didn't expect it to be so absurd, but this was really funny!</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>What If Women Designed the City?</h3>
        <p class="meta">May East</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Reads like a casual textbook, but gives some really interesting concepts and ideas that make cities more sustainable and friendly.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Future is Analog: How to Create a More Human World</h3>
        <p class="meta">David Sax</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Although I don't agree with every single point the author makes, I think the book makes a really important commentary on the importance of quality physical time with one another,</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Social Contract</h3>
        <p class="meta">Rousseau</p>
        <p class="excerpt">I've read excerpts of this book many times, so I thought I'd go ahead and read the whole thing. As expected some of the ideas (especially in the latter half) are outdated or state some false facts but overall really interesting. </p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>Anarchism and Other Essays</h3>
        <p class="meta">Emma Goldman</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> Emma Goldman quickly became one of my favorite writers. Except for maybe one or two essays on the events of her time, all the essays here were really interesting to think about and read.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="post">
        <h3>How to Blow Up A Pipeline</h3>
        <p class="meta">Andreas Malm</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Athough the book reads more like one big thesis, its very good at making its point. Theres a movie based on this book and I'd want to watch it.</p>

        <h3>Blog Post Title</h3>
        <p class="meta">Posted on May 18, 2025 by Author</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...</p>
      </article>   

      <article class="post">
        <h3>Giovanni's Room</h3>
        <p class="meta">James Baldwin</p>
        <p class="excerpt"> One of my favorites! I think its really interesting how despite this book being written by James Baldwin, it takes place in Europe and is absent of any characters of color. Its themes mostly focus on queerness and identity. </p>
      </article>  

      <article class="post">
        <h3>I, Who Has Never Known Men</h3>
        <p class="meta">Jacqueline Harpman</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Short, but I think the point the book makes can apply outside of the female context the book uses. Really cool feminist food for thought.</p>
      </article>  
      
      <article class="post">
        <h3>Forgiving Imelda Marcos</h3>
        <p class="meta">Nathan Go</p>
        <p class="excerpt">I think it was kinda of weird to use a real-life politican for the subject of the book, but I loved the importance of the cultural/historical context when it came to the relationships between characters.</p>
      </article>    

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Diary of Adam and Eve</h3>
        <p class="meta">Mark Twain</p>
        <p class="excerpt">This was a really funny short read. The title is very literal.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="post">
        <h3>A Thousand Splendid Suns</h3>
        <p class="meta">Khaled Hosseini</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Really sad, but also really good.</p>
      </article>  

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Testaments</h3>
        <p class="meta">Margret Atwood</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Although I think as a sequel to the Handmaids Tale the plot was very influenced by the show and other adaptations, the importance and meaning of the story are still the same. Especially now more than ever, eveyrone should read the Handmaids Tale and understand where it comes from.</p>
      </article> 

      <article class="post">
        <h3>All Art is Propaganda</h3>
        <p class="meta">George Orwell</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Normally I like Orwell, but these were kinda boring.</p>
      </article>  

      <article class="post">
        <h3>The Athiests Mass</h3>
        <p class="meta">Honore de Balzac</p>
        <p class="excerpt">A good short story, gives a more nuanced view on having a relationship with spirituality and religon.</p>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>Hi! This was a little project to get some stuff done in HTML and CSS. I normally keep my reading lists in a spreadsheet, but thought it'd be fun to switch it up! I didn't include one-off poetry I've read but any books, essays, and short stories are here. This is mostly for my reads in 2025, but the favorites page covers my all-time favorites.</p>
